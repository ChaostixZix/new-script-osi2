# Batch Processing Configuration
# Generated on 2025-09-20T17:21:36.538Z

# Number of worker threads to use
# Recommended: 4 (based on 4 CPU cores)
# Range: 1-8 (higher = faster but more API calls)
WORKER_COUNT=4

# Number of participants to process in each batch
# Recommended: 10
# Range: 5-50 (higher = more memory usage)
BATCH_SIZE=10

# Rate limiting delay between API calls (milliseconds)
# Recommended: 100ms
# Range: 50-500ms (lower = faster but may hit rate limits)
API_DELAY=100

# Google Sheets Configuration
# Set these in your .env file
# GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your_sheet_id_here
# WORKSHEET_NAME=Form Response 1

# Performance Tips:
# - For API rate limits: Increase API_DELAY or decrease WORKER_COUNT
# - For memory issues: Decrease BATCH_SIZE or WORKER_COUNT
# - For maximum speed: Increase WORKER_COUNT (but watch rate limits)
